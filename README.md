 My name is Rahshon Kelly and I’m very interested in learning a new program. I’m currently in a training course for Cybersecurity and working toward getting my certification. 
 I’m in the process of learning Cybersecurity tools, terminology, and security. 
 I also understand how the systems work when you’re under a cyberattack, leaked by accident or intentional, and how to store data properly.
 My goals are to be able to protect and prevent companies and people from harm. 
 I’m a team player who will do anything they want me to do and will help them when asked or if I see anyone who is struggling. 
 I’m the type of person who will always respect others and value their suggestions, opinions and the company's policies. I will be on time and am willing to work extra time if needed.
 What interests me the most is security controls so everyone will be protected. I can work for any company who is looking to hire me. 
 As for victims being scammed and others as well, I want to learn and help people understand how to avoid risky situations and look for red flags. 
 I want to bring security awareness to the people who are being targeted and be prepared for the next one.
